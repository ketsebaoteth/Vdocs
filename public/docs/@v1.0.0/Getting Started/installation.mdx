# Welcome to VDocs Documentation

VDocs is a tool for creating server-side rendered documentation sites directly from your project's documentation files. It is designed to be framework and language agnostic, making it suitable for a wide range of projects. VDocs utilizes Markdown (with MDX support) for content creation.

<Codeblock> npx create vdocs@latest </Codeblock>


## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

*   Node.js
*   npm (or compatible package manager)

**Installation:**

1.  Open your project's root directory in your terminal.
2.  Run the following command:
    ```bash
    npx vdocs@latest init <your-project-name>
    ```
    This will create a `vdocs` directory within your project.
3.  Navigate into the new `vdocs` directory:
    ```bash
    cd <your-project-name>
    ```
4.  Install VDocs dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    VDocs is now ready to run!

## Basic Usage

VDocs leverages your project's file structure to create your documentation site. Here's a quick overview:

*   **Configuration:** VDocs uses TypeScript configuration files located in the `config/` directory within your `vdocs` project. Modify these `.tsx` files to customize the site (e.g., navigation bar, general settings).
*   **Styling:** The site's appearance is primarily managed through the `global.css` file. It is recommended to use CSS variables for colors and styles within this file. *Note:* We made a conscious decision to use a standard css file for styling over complex configuration files for ease of use and better editing support in IDE's.
*   **Documentation Pages:** VDocs generates documentation pages based on the folder structure inside the `/docs/` directory. This structure mirrors the navigation on your documentation site.
    *   **Version Management:** Document versions using the `@v<version>` naming convention inside the `/docs/` folder. For example, `/docs/@v1.0.0` or `/docs/@v1.1.0`.
        *   **Partial Versioning:** You *don't* need to duplicate the entire `/docs/` structure for every version. Only include the folders and markdown files that have actually changed from the base version. For example, if only two files change in `@v1.1.0`, only those files need to exist in the `/docs/@v1.1.0/` directory. VDocs will then take the default documentation structure and only override the sections modified by a newer version.
