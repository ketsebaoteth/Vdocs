# VDocs Components

VDocs provides a suite of custom components that enhance the functionality and visual appeal of your documentation written in MDX. These components are designed for seamless integration and ease of use.

## Tabbed Code Blocks

The `<TabbedCodeBlock>` component enables you to display code snippets within interactive tabs, improving organization and clarity. This is particularly useful when demonstrating the same task across multiple platforms or environments.

<TabbedCodeBlock tabs='[
  { "name": "NPM", "command": "npx create vdocs@latest" },
  { "name": "Bun", "command": "bun init vdocs@latest" },
  { "name": "Yarn", "command": "yarn create vdocs@latest" }
]' />

**Usage:**

The `<TabbedCodeBlock>` component accepts a `tabs` prop which is an array of objects. Each object defines the properties of the tab such as the name and the command.

**MDX Syntax Example:**

<Codeblock details="docs/v1.0.0/Example/example.mdx" lang="markdown" content=" 
## normal markdown like this then

<TabbedCodeBlock tabs='[
  { 'name': 'NPM', 'command': 'npx create vdocs@latest' },
  { 'name': 'Bun', 'command': 'bun init vdocs@latest' },
  { 'name': 'Yarn', 'command': 'yarn create vdocs@latest' }
]' />
 "/>

This translates to the following Vue component syntax:

<Codeblock lang="vue"
content='
<TabbedCodeBlock tabs="[ { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;NPM&quot;, &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx create vdocs@latest&quot; }, { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Bun&quot;, &quot;command&quot;: &quot;bun init vdocs@latest&quot; }, { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Yarn&quot;, &quot;command&quot;: &quot;yarn create vdocs@latest&quot; } ]" />
'/>

---

## Callouts

The `<Callout>` component is used to draw attention to specific information within your documentation, such as important notes, warnings, errors, or success messages. Callouts provide a visually distinct way to highlight key points.

A typical **Callout** looks like this:

<Callout type="error" header="This is an error message" content="Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to " />

**Types of Callouts:**

The `type` prop determines the visual styling and semantic meaning of the callout. Supported values include:

*   `info`: Used for general informational notes (Default).
*   `warning`: Indicates a potential issue or caution.
*   `error`: Highlights critical errors or problems.
*   `success`: Signals a successful operation or positive outcome.

**Other Available Props:**

*   `header`: Sets the title/heading of the callout.
*   `content`: Contains the main body text of the callout.

**Examples:**

<Callout type="info" header="This is an info message" content="Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to " />

<Callout type="warning" header="This is a warning message" content="Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to " />

<Callout type="success" header="This is a success message" content="Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to " />

**MDX Syntax Example:**

<Codeblock lang="markdown"
content='<Callout type="warning" header="Heads Up!" content="Always double-check your configuration settings before deploying." />' />

This is equivalent to the following vue component markup:

<Codeblock lang="vue"
content='
<Callout type="info" header="This is an info message" content="Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&apos;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to " />' />

## Tables

VDocs supports the standard Markdown table syntax, rendering them as styled and accessible HTML tables. This allows you to present structured data effectively.

A basic **Table** looks like this:

| Column 1      | Column 2      |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Cell 1, Row 1 | Cell 2, Row 1 |
| Cell 1, Row 2 | Cell 2, Row 2 |
| Cell 1, Row 3 | Cell 2, Row 3 |
| Cell 1, Row 4 | Cell 2, Row 4 |

**Markdown Table Syntax:**

The syntax for creating a table in Markdown involves using pipes (`|`) to separate columns and hyphens (`-`) to create a header row separator:

```markdown
| Column 1      | Column 2      |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Cell 1, Row 1 | Cell 2, Row 1 |
| Cell 1, Row 2 | Cell 2, Row 2 |
| Cell 1, Row 3 | Cell 2, Row 3 |
| Cell 1, Row 4 | Cell 2, Row 4 |
```

This is translated into the following:

<Codeblock lang="markdown"
content='| Column 1      | Column 2      |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Cell 1, Row 1 | Cell 2, Row 1 |
| Cell 1, Row 2 | Cell 2, Row 2 |
| Cell 1, Row 3 | Cell 2, Row 3 |
| Cell 1, Row 4 | Cell 2, Row 4 |' />

Note that VDocs will automatically recognize and style markdown table syntax.

## Example Usage

This section demonstrates how to use these components together to create a cohesive and informative page in MDX.

```md
# Example Usage

<TabbedCodeBlock tabs="[ { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;NPM&quot;, &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx create vdocs@latest&quot; }, { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Bun&quot;, &quot;command&quot;: &quot;bun init vdocs@latest&quot; }, { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Yarn&quot;, &quot;command&quot;: &quot;yarn create vdocs@latest&quot; } ]" />

<Callout type="info" header="Important Note" content="Remember to install all required dependencies before running the application." />
