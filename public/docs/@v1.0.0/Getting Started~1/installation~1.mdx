## Creating project
Prerequisites:
 - Node.js-'18.x' or newer (but we recommend the latest LTS version)
 - Text Editor-There is no specific text editor required, but we recommend using the following setup:
    - Visual Studio Code
    - Mdx Extension ( For better MDX support ).
 - npm (or compatible package manager 'yarn', 'bun' or 'pnpm' are supported)
 - Git (optional)

if you are using Visual Studio Code, you can open the integrated terminal by pressing `Ctrl + ` ` and use the following command to create a new Vdocs project Setup:

<TabbedCodeBlock tabs='[
{"name":"NPM","command":"npx create vdocs@latest"},
{"name":"BUN","command":"bun create vdocs@latest"},
{"name":"YARN","command":"yarn create vdocs@latest"},
{"name":"PNPM","command":"pnpm create vdocs@latest"}
]' />

then you can navigate to the project director and run the following command to install dependencies `vdocs` has:

<Codeblock lang="install-script" details="~vscodeTerminal~" content="npm install //or any compatible package manager as always" />

after running the command, you vdocs project is ready to run. you can start the project by running the following command:

<Codeblock lang="install-script" details="~vscodeTerminal~" content="npm run dev //or any compatible package manager as always" />

this will start the development server and you can access the project by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Next Steps

Now that you have finished creating your project, you can start modifing the project to fit your needs. you can start by modifying the `config` directory to change the site's configuration, or you can start by modifying the `docs` directory to change the documentation pages.
