## Folder Structure

To work with Vdocs the most important folders to keep an eye on are:
 - `public/docs` - This is where all the documentation files are stored. The folder structure inside this directory is used to generate the documentation site's navigation.
 - `public/docs/@v<version>` - This is where the versioned documentation files are stored. The version number is used to generate the version dropdown in the navigation bar.
 - `config` - This is where all the configs that alter Vdocs are stored.
 - `components/Extenders` - This is a special folder where each element inside of this folder is imported into different places in the vdocs site which means adding new content here is a great option if you want to extend upon the basic vdocs starter.

In The `/public/docs` folder you first have folders for different versions of your documentation. If you dont have any versioned yet you will see only the default `@v1.0.0` folder. Inside the versioned folders you will see the following structure:

Inside the versioned folders you will see a folder representing a catagory. vdocs translates each folder in your docs page as a catagory and creates a collapsable section for it.Then inside of each folder you have `.mdx` files which represent the actual documentation pages.
